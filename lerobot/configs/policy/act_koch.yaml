  # These transforms are all using standard torchvision.transforms.v2
  # You can find out how these transformations affect images here:
  # https://pytorch.org/vision/0.18/auto_examples/transforms/plot_transforms_illustrations.html
  # We use a custom RandomSubsetApply container to sample them.
  # For each transform, the following parameters are available:
  #   weight: This represents the multinomial probability (with no replacement)
  #           used for sampling the transform. If the sum of the weights is not 1,
  #           they will be normalized.
  #   min_max: Lower & upper bound respectively used for sampling the transform's parameter
  #           (following uniform distribution) when it's applied.
    # Set this flag to `true` to enable transforms during training
